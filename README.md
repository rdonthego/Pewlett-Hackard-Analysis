# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis#
Relational Data Base Project

##Overview of the Analysis##

Pewlett Hackard is anticipating many retirements in the next few years and are preparing for future needs for the company.  This project requested that information be communicated about the number of retiring employees for each title as well as those eligible to participate in a mentorship.  Also requested is a summary of the analysis.

##Results##
1.  Prior to cleaning the data it is noted that the employees potentially retiring have many years of service with the company.

2.  Since many of the upcoming retirees had been with the company for a long period of time, it was necessary to filter and remove the duplicate titles.  After removal of the titles there are a total of 90,397 employees retiring.

3.In addition to many employees retiring, there will be gaps in several departments.  The biggest gaps are in senior positions in the company.

4. There are 1549 employees that are on the mentorship list.  This is a very small number to prepare for needed additions.  I included a snip to illustrate that many of the mentorship positions are not senior positions.

#Summary#

1.  How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Pewlett Hackard needs to prepare to look at the gap of 90,397 retirements.  Current preparations would be to look to see if any positions can be eliminated before rehiring this many employees.  Perhaps they need to hire a different type or position of employee.  After answering these questions, it would be time to look at potential promotable employees and then looking at targeted recruitment plans for new employees from other competitors and/or new graduates from universities with strong engineering programs. Another potential labor pool may be to look at those from foreign markets in addition to within the US.


2.  Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are not enough mentors available for the next generation of employees. There are only 1549 potential mentors for possibly 90,000+ new team members. Hewlett Packard may want to initiate a potential mentor training program for those not ready to retire.  This would be a positive investment in employee development to prepare them to promote and peak the interest of earlier career employees to positively impact their new teammates.  All is not lost; this will require a new paradigm for a traditionally structured company.
